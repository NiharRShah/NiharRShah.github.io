        <p>This page is to get all information about github and how to combine github with cloud9 to explore the field of coding.I hope this would be a lot more useful.
        Once you are done with your coding part, just type "git add" and the file name of the code . This will create a connection with the git repositories.Now you can say "git commit -m"name_of_commit".This will help you save all the coding stuff. Finally you can 
        push your data with"git push -u origin master. For any further query,</p>
